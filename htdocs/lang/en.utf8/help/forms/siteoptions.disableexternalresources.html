<h1>Disable external resources in HTML</h1>

<p>Turning this on will prevent people from embedding images and other content from remote sites into their forum posts and other HTML content.</p>

<p>It is however a good thing to do from a security standpoint since it does neutralise a few clever phishing attacks.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/live/configdoc/plain.html#URI.DisableExternalResources">HTML Purifier documentation</a> for more details.</p>

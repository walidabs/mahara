<h1>Create and edit group content</h1>
<p>You can choose which group members will be allowed to create and edit portfolios, journals, files, and plans owned by the group. Permissions can be changed on individual files in the group files area.</p>

<p>If your group contains only members and administrators, then "Group administrators" and "Everyone except ordinary members" are identical.</p>

<p>When you want to set up assignment plans, you can only allow "Everyone except ordinary members" or "Group administrators" to create content. Otherwise, normal group members cannot work with assignment plans as they would be able to change the assignments.</p>

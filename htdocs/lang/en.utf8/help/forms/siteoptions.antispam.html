<h1>Anti-spam</h1>

<p>There are three levels of anti-spam protection available for publicly
visible forms, such as the Contact us and Registration forms. A form
submission is never silently rejected. Rather, an error message is displayed asking the person to try again if the submission is classified as spam.</p>

<p><strong>None: </strong>No anti-spam checks will be performed on form submissions.</p>

<p><strong>Simple: </strong>Some basic checks are performed. Form submissions with email addresses that are not well-formed or that have an excessive number of URLs are rejected.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced: </strong>(Requires an internet connection). Performs additional checks to determine whether email addresses are real, or contained URLs that are prohibited.</p>

<h1>Drop-down navigation</h1>
<p>The drop-down menu navigation chosen here only influences the theme
for <strong>this institution</strong>.</p>

<p>Site-wide themes take on the <strong>site settings</strong>.</p>

<p>If you cannot change the "On / Off" switch, you have chosen to use the site's default theme. That means that you will also use the site setting for the drop-down menu. If you wish to use the theme that the site uses, but don't want to use the same menu, please select the theme above from the drop-down menu (and not "Site default"). Then you will be able to change the setting for the drop-down navigation.</p>

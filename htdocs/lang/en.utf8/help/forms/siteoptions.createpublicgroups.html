<h1>Publicly viewable groups</h1>
<p>If you wish to allow everyone to create groups that may be viewed by people who are not members of your site, set this option to 'Everyone'.</p>
<p>In a public group, anyone who finds your site (including search engines) will be able to see the group's &quot;About&quot; page, and all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the site before they can perform other actions such as posting to the forums or viewing profiles.
<p>Viewing the list of group members for group members and non-members can be restricted by the group administrator.</p>
<p>If isolated institutions are turned on in the config.php file, only site administrators will be able to create public groups.</p>

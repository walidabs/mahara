<h1>People allowed multiple institutions</h1>
<p>If enabled, people can belong to more than one institution at once. People will be able to apply to join an institution at any time, although the institution will have to approve their request first. Likewise, institutions will be able to invite people, but people must approve this request.</p>
<p>If isolated institutions are turned on in the config.php file, people can only be in one institution. Being a member of multiple institutions is not allowed.</p>

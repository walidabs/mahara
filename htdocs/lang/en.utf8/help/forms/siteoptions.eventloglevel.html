<h1>Log events</h1>
<p>Events are generated every time somebody does anything significant on the site, e.g. editing a page.</p>
<p>Optionally, a log of these events can be kept in the database. You can keep either all events, which could be a lot of data and database activity on a busy site, or only those events pertaining to the masquerading of an administrator as another person when using the "Log in as" functionality.
This log is kept in the event_log table in the database. A report of masquerading sessions is available in the "Reports" section.</p>
<p>If you want to use the advanced analytics functionality, you need to log all events and not just the masquerading ones.</p>
<p>No matter which setting you choose, all events are still logged in the access log.</p>

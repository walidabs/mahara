<h1>Shared page notifications</h1>
<p>Select which group members should receive a notification when a new group page is created and when a group member shares one of their pages with the group.</p>
<p>The group member sharing the page will not receive this notification. For very large groups it would be best to limit this to non ordinary members as it can produce a lot of notifications.</p>
<p>Enter the numerical value into your CSV file that corresponds to the option you want to select.</p>
<ul>The options are:
    <li><em>0</em> = None</li>
    <li><em>1</em> = All group members</li>
    <li><em>2</em> = Everyone except ordinary members</li>
    <li><em>3</em> = Group administrators</li>
</ul>

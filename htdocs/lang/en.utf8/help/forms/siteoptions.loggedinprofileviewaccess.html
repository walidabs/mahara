<h1>Logged-in profile access</h1>
<p>Enable this option if you want to make sure all people can see each
others' profile pages.</p>
<p>If this option is unchecked, profile pages are initially viewable
by all registered people, but the owner is allowed to restrict access to
a smaller group if they wish.</p>
<p>Profiles of institution members will always be visible to other
members of the same institution.</p>
<p>If isolated institutions are turned on in the config.php file,
people will only be able to see the profile pages of people who are also members in their institution and the site administrators.</p>

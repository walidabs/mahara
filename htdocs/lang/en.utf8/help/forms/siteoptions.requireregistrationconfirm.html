<h1>Require 'Confirm registrations'</h1>

<p>If your site or any institution on it allow self-registration, you may wish
  to use this setting. It will require an administrator to approve people who
  self-register on the site, preventing people who are not allowed on the site,
  e.g. spammers, from creating accounts unnoticed.</p>

<p>If you do not use this setting and allow self-registration, institutions can
  decide whether to require account confirmation or not for self-registering
  people.</p>

<p>When you don't use "Confirm registration" either for the entire site or on
  an institution by institution basis, accounts are created even when an
  institution administrator does not approve a person registering for their
  institution. The account would be created in the default site, the "No institution".</p>

<p>Self-registration without any administrator approval may be useful for sites
  that are open to the public for registration. Institutions though should always
  consider using the registration confirmation to only give access to their members.</p>

<p>If isolated institutions are turned on in the config.php file, the "Confirm
  registration" on the site level is turned on per default so that institutions
  cannot change that setting. Site administrators cannot change the setting either. Every account needs to be approved.</p>

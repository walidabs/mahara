<h1>Friends control</h1>
<p>Choose whether others may add this person to their friends list. If the person is added to a friends list, the owner of that list is added to the person's list as well. When the person removes someone from their friends list, the person is also removed from the other person's list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add you as a friend:</strong> no one may add this person to their friends list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends require my authorisation:</strong> the person's authorisation is needed for them to be added to a friends list. If they approve, they will be added to a friends list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add the person to their list.</p>

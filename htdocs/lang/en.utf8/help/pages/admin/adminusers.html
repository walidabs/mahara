<h1>Administrators</h1>
<p>Administrator access allows a person to do anything and go anywhere on the site. Administrators cannot directly see other people's portfolios, although they can log in as another person to do this if necessary. "Site Administrator" is the top role on the site. Be careful who you trust with it!</p>
<p>To assign a person administrator access, select them from the list of "Potential administrators" and use the right-arrow button to move them to the "Current administrator" list. To remove administrator access, select their name from the "Current administrators" list and using the left-arrow button move them back to the "Potential administrators" list.</p>
<p>Where there are more than 250 accounts on the site, you will need to search for a specific person using the search box. You can also select multiple people at once using "Ctrl + Shift" select and click.</p>
<p>There must be at least one site administrator assigned to the system.</p>

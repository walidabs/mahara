<ul>

<li>The display name, acronym and icon are shown for the content license rather than the URL.</li>

<li>If the "License metadata" setting is checked in the "General settings" section of "Site options", the licenses are displayed to authors when they create content.</li>

<li>Authors are restricted to the licenses configured here unless the "Allow custom licenses" setting is checked in the "General settings" section of "Site options".</li>

</ul></p>

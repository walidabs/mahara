<h1>Groups</h1>
<p>You can search for groups and get basic information about them. If a group administrator decided to hide a group, you will not be able to see it unless you have been invited to it.</p>
<p>This page can list the groups you are related to in some way.</p>
<p>You can see the groups you own or are a member of, as well as groups you have been invited to or have asked to join.</p>
<p>When in a group, you can share your own portfolio pages with the other members and participate in group activities such as discussion forums.</p>

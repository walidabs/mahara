<h1>Pages and collections</h1>
<h2>Pages</h2>
<p>A page contains a selection of artefacts which you arrange and present to
  others. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>selected files</li>
<li>résumé details</li>
<li>text (your added commentary, instructions or descriptions)</li>
<li>journal posts</li>
<li>video and audio files</li>
<li>RSS feed to an external blog</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</uL>
<p>You can re-use the artefacts that you collected under "Content" in as many pages as you wish.</p>
<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>A collection is a set of pages that are linked to one another and have the
  same access permissions. You can create as many collections as you like, but a page cannot appear in more than one collection.</p>
<p>You can create a collection from scratch or copy an existing one - either
  one of your own or one from somebody else that is copyable to you.</p>

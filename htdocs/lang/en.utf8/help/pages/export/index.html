<h1>Export your portfolio</h1>
<p>You can export your portfolio to keep your files and content offline. You can create an export at any time and as often as you wish. When you export you will recive a zip file containing the following:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone HTML website:</strong> Files containing a website with your portfolio data are created. You cannot import this into Mahara or another portfolio system again, but it is readable in a standard web browser and you do not need Mahara in order to view it. To view, extract the zip file and click on the index.html file that is in the HTML folder.</p>
<p><strong>Leap2A:</strong> A file containing a folder in the Leap2A standard format is created. You can then import this into another Leap2A-compliant system.

<h1>Authentication password for writing to index</h1>

<p>If your Elasticsearch server requires a different HTTP basic authentication username and password to write to index, you may provide the <strong>password</strong> here. <strong>Note:</strong> The core Elasticsearch software itself does not provide username or password features, but you may achieve this functionality by using a plugin, such as Search Guard, or by accessing it through a proxy.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed through the web interface. You may change it by setting a value in your config.php file for the following config variable:</p>
<p><code>$cfg->plugin_search_elasticsearch_password</code>.</p>

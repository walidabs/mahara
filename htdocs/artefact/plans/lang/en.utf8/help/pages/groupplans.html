<h1>Create a plan</h1>
<p>In your personal area, you can create plans for yourself and set up templates for assignment plans.</p>

<p>Your <strong>personal plans</strong> can be todo lists for any sort of activities you would like to track.</p>

<p>Your <strong>template plans</strong> help you set up assignment plans for learners that you can use in groups as starting point.</p>

<p>Template plans typically contain explicit tasks for learners to complete. You can associate a template portfolio with each task making it easy for learners to copy these into their personal portfolio areas.</p>

<p>When you set up a <strong>group plan</strong>, you can decide whether to use one of your template plans as starting point or whether to set up a plan from scratch. You can set up assignment plans directly in a group as well.</p>

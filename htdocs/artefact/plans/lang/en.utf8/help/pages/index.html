<h1>Plans</h1>
<p>Plans are task lists. They are particularly well-suited to plan medium and long-term endeavours. A plan can consist of a number of individual activities with which completion dates are associated.</p>
<p>You could use the functionality to:</p>
<ul>
<li>set yourself individual goals for a large task.</li>
<li>manage your personal learning activities and keep an eye on how many you have already accomplished during the time frame that you have set yourself.</li>
<li>keep track of workshops you have attended for your professional development over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set up template plans in your personal account. You can then use them when you want to create plans for groups of learners in multiple groups.</p>
<p>Learners can copy plans that contain assignments into their own accounts to complete these assignments.</p>

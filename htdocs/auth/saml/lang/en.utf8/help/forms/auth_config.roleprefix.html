<h1>SAML 2.0 field for role prefix</h1>
<p>If the Identity Provider (IdP) passes in role information for the
person logging in, then you can set this 'prefix' field so that only
those roles starting with the prefix should be handled by Mahara.</p>
<p>This way the IdP can have different roles for different Service
Providers (SP). If the person does not have any roles relating to
this prefix, they will not be allowed to log in.</p>

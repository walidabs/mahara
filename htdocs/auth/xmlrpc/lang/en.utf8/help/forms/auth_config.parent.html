<h1>Parent authority</h1>
<p>If you set a parent authority, people will be able to log in using that authority and log in via Moodle.</p>
<p>For example, you could set up LDAP and have that be the parent of this authentication method. That means that people will be able to log in via Mahara's built-in login form using their LDAP credentials, and they can also log in via Moodle and get into the same account.</p>
<p>You do not have to set a parent authority. If you do not, people will only be able to log in via Moodle.</p>

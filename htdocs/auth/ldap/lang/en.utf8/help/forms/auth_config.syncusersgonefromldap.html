<h1>If an account is no longer present in LDAP</h1>
<p>This setting determines what the cron will do if a person in your
institution has no matching record in your LDAP server.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This setting only applies to people who have this authentication
instance as their authentication method.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Do nothing</dt>
<dd>No action will be taken. (This is the recommended setting.)</dd>
<dt>Suspend account</dt>
<dd>The account will be suspended. The account holder will no longer be able to
  log in, and their content and portfolios will not be viewable. However, none of
  their data will be deleted, and the person can be un-suspended by the cron
  when their LDAP record reappears, or manually by an administrator.</dd>
<dt>Delete account and all content</dt>
<dd><strong>Use with caution!</strong> The account will be deleted along with all the
  content and portfolios held within it. The data is fully deleted from the
  server. If anything from this account is still needed, a full backup of the
  instance is needed to retrieve the account.</dd>

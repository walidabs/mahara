<h1>Additional LDAP filter for sync</h1>
<p>Provide an LDAP filter here, and the sync will only see accounts in
LDAP that match this filter.</p>
<p>Use this setting with caution if you have auto-suspend or auto-delete
enabled, as doing so will cause all accounts in your institution which
<strong>do not</strong> match the filter to be suspended or deleted.</p>
<p>Example: uid=user*</p>
